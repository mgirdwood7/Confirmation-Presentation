## The Problem

- ACL reconstruction rates are growing by 2.5% / year .font60[(Zbrojkiewicz, 2018)]

- Direct costs / year of 142 million ( + future disease burden) .font60[(Zbrojkiewicz, 2018)]

- Over 2/3 of people develop radiographic OA, and 1/3 will suffer from symptomatic OA within 10 years of injury .font60[(Lie, 2019)]

&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
.content-box[**.black[We need to understand:]**

- what causes people to decline in function
- what can we do to enhance our treatment
- what can be done to reduce the future burden]

## Muscle Strength

Regaining muscle strength is a focus of rehabilitation, however our efforts often fall short:

.pull-left[#### Quadriceps &amp; Hamstring Strength

- Up to 20% deficit at 12 months compared to the uninjured side .font60[(Palmieri-Smith, 2008)]

- Weakness of moderate to large effect sizes when compared to healthy populations .font60[(Brown, 2021)]

- Weakness persists beyond 24 months .font60[(Tayfur, 2020)]
]

## Muscle Strength

.pull-left[
- Deficits in strength span different contraction types and speeds .font60[(Tayfur, 2020)]. 

- They also extend to other muscle groups - the calf and the hip are also impaired .font60[(Thomas, 2013)].

## Muscle impairments   
&lt;br&gt;
#### Strength isn't the only problem:

| Altered muscle timing/activation with landing tasks (EMG)  | Significant      | Healthy Controls              | Rocchi, 2020     |
| Reduced muscle quality on biopsies                                 | Large            | Un-injured limb               | Peck, 2019       |

## ACL injury leads to wide-ranging detrimental effects on muscles and their function - even after rehabilitation has finished.

---

## Why is muscle function important?

- Determinant of successful return to pre-injury activity .font60[(Grindem, 2016)].

- Improved long term outcomes. 
  - Better quads strength = better self reported knee function @ 2 years .font60[(van Wyngaarden, 2021)] 

- Maintenance of joint health 
  - Quadriceps weakness associated with a 1.65x higher risk of developing non-traumatic knee OA .font60[(Øiestad, 2010)].
  
  - Less important in ACLR populations compared to trauma from injury? .font60[(Øiestad, 2015)].

---

## Central Nervous System

.content-box[#### We must also consider other aspects of the human movement system to optimise treatment and long term outcomes after knee injury .
]

.pull-left[&lt;br&gt;
- Ongoing deficits in muscle strength or physical function may be partly mediated by changes in the CNS .font60[(Rodriguez, 2020)]

]
]

---

## CNS - What do we know? 🧠

- Lower cortico-spinal excitability of the quadriceps bilaterally after ACL injury (measured with TMS) .font60[(Rodriguez, 2020)]

- fMRI shows changes in activity levels across motor, visual and somatosensory brain regions .font60[(Neto, 2019)]

- Evidence of central re-organisation of motor and sensory brain regions .font60[(Needle, 2017)]

- Most current rehabilitation approaches don't target CNS impairments .font60[(Criss, 2021)]

- Altered sensory processing is a possible contributor to persistent neuromuscular deficits after knee injury .font60[(Roos, 2011; Kapreli, 2006; Ward, 2015)] 

- Disrupted **inputs** precipitate CNS reorganisation.font60[(Buonomano, 1998)], and can lead to altered .red[output] .font60[(Parsons, 2001)]
]

## Cortical Representations of the Body

.content-box[It is also possible the CNS processes involved in incorporating afferent inputs, motor planning and other contextual factors may be dysfunctional
]

These have been termed **cortical representations** .font60[(Moseley &amp; Flor, 2012)].

Importantly, we can assess cortical representations with novel methods that use the same central processes .font60[(Moseley &amp; Flor, 2012)]. 

---

## Why is this important?

.pull-left[
- Treatments targeting both the periphery (e.g. muscle strength) and the CNS (maximising neuroplasticity) are under-researched .font60[(Needle, 2017)]

## Thesis Aims
&gt; 1. To determine the trajectory of lower-limb muscle strength after ACL injury, specifically the muscles of the thigh, lower leg and hip

&gt; 2. To determine whether cortical representations are altered after ACL injury

&gt; 3. Determine whether incorporating understanding of cortical representations with training for muscle strength can enhance strength outcomes

## Study 1
###The trajectory of muscle strength and physical function changes after ACL injury: a systematic review

---
## Overview


.pull-left-2[
.content-box[**.black[The problem:]**] 

- Temporal changes in muscle strength - *i.e. how time influences change in outcomes* - is poorly understood after ACL injury.

  - This relationship is critical to understanding prognosis.
  
- We also don't know how weakness in one muscle relates to another, or how this links to physical function

## Overview

#### Several previous reviews have looked at muscle strength and physical function with limitations:


- Lack of quantitative synthesis .font60[(Abrams, 2014)]
- measuring single muscle groups only .font60[(Moloney, 2014; Lisee, 2019)]
- focusing on graft comparisons only .font60[(Xergia, 2011)]
- not comparing to un-injured controls .font60[(Abrams, 2014)]

.content-box[
**No-one has looked at quantitative synthesis of:**
- longitudinal changes in muscle strength
- strength of hip and calf muscles
- physical function deficits compared to controls
]
---

## Data Analysis Plan - Primary Aim

- Longitudinal meta-analysis, conducted with framework described by *Ishak et al, 2007, Clin Trials*

&lt;img src = "ishak.png"  width = 80%/&gt;

- Employs mixed-effect models to account for correlations *within* and *between* studies .font90[(allowing multiple timepoints to be contributed from one cohort)]

- Follow up timepoints of included studies will be inputed as categorical or continuous values, with best fit evaluated for final analysis (using AIC and BIC)

## Study 2: 

### The influence of hip muscle strength on patellofemoral joint outcomes following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.


---
## Why the hip after ACL Reconstruction?


.pull-left[
#### What we know:
- 24% of people suffer from patellofemoral pain at 1 year post ACLR .font60[(Culvenor, 2017)]

- Hip muscle weakness is characteristic of PFJ pain and knee osteoarthritis .font60[(Rathleff, 2014)]

- Hip rotation muscles play a role in the control of knee positioning during movement .font60[(Cashman, 2012)]

]


.pull-right[
#### What we **don't** know:

- Limited research into hip rotation strength after ACLR

- Whether hip rotation strength is associated with long term knee sypmtoms

]
---
class: inverse, middle

## Research Question: 

&gt; - How does hip strength differ between the injured and non-injured side in people 1-year after ACLR?

&gt; 

&gt; - Is hip strength associated with functional, symptomatic and structural outcomes?

---

## Methods: participants

.pull-left[
- Longitudinal study monitoring knee joint structure, function and symptoms (Culvenor et al, 2015)

- Primary ACLR (HS autograft) 1 year prior 

- No structured rehab

## Assocation to .green[Function]

- Both Hip ER and IR were associated with all  measures at 1 year and 5 years.

- Strongest relationships with &lt;u&gt;Hop for Distance&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;Triple Crossover Hop&lt;/u&gt; for both.

- Adjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; values were lower at 5 years:

## Association to .blue[Symptoms]

- .font90[**Higher** hip ER &amp; IR strength was associated with **superior** AKPS  at 1 and 5 years.]

.center[&lt;img src = "ameplot.png" width = "107%"/&gt;]

---

## Assocation to .red[Structure] (Imaging)

Lower hip ER strength was associated with **worsening tibio-femoral** cartilage lesion score **.black[at 5 years]**  (OR 0.01 (95%CI 0.00 to 0.41))

&lt;br&gt;

.center[
&lt;img src = "ORForest.png" width = 82%/&gt;]

---

## Discussion

- Hip ER may influence symptoamtic and structural outcomes as it is critical to single leg functional tasks.
 
- ER specific weakness could result from:

  -  lack of training/rehab

  - weakness broadly of the entire lower limb (not specific to the hip). 

.center[
&lt;img src = "deadlift.jpeg" width = "50%" /&gt;

class: middle

## Key Summary

.content-box[
- Hip ER strength was impaired on the injured side at 1 year post ACLR

- This may contribute to functional, symptomatic, and structural outcomes up to 5 years post-operatively.

- Contrary to initial hypothesis, hip rotation strength was not associated with PFJ structure

&gt; 1. Determine whether people after ACLR have worse implicit motor imagery and auditory detection testing performance, compared to healthy controls or the non-injured limb.

&gt; 2. Investigate whether performance on these tests relates to self-reported and physical function outcomes

---
## Procedure

**.black[Design]**: Case-control Study adhering to STROBE guidelines

**.black[Participants]**: Participants from Study 3 form the ACLR group. 

**.black[Comparator]**: Healthy control group recruited through university advertisement, word of mouth and social networks.

**Control group - Inclusion criteria:**

.font90[
- No current musculoskeletal complaints 
- No history of any knee injury on either side of the body 
- No history of neurological disease 
- No history of major lower limb surgery, or significant lower limb pain of over 6 months in duration 
- Age between 30-60 
- Previous participation in Level I or II sports (jumping cutting pivoting sports or lateral movements.)

## Left-Right Judgement

.pull-left[&lt;img src = "lrj_knee.png" /&gt;]

.pull-right[

- Testing of implicit motor imagery using the Recognise App (NOI Group)

- Used extensively in musculoskeletal research .font60[(Breckenridge, 2017)], and has good reliability .font60[(Williams, 2019)].

- Participants must judge whether the image corresponds to the left or right side

- Two measures - accuracy, and reaction time
]
---
## Left-Right Judgement

.pull-left[
- One set of 20 images for familiarisation

- One set of 40 **knee** images and 40 **hand** images

## Spatial acuity testing

.pull-left[ **Auditory Detection Testing**

- 40 sounds played from a smartphone using custom designed web app

- 1000 Hz true tone, ~80 dB, 5 seconds apart

- Participants told to respond verbally as to which side of the body they hear the sound coming from

## Auditory Detection Testing
.pull-left[

&lt;img src = "audtest_position.jpg" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[

- Site of sound is randomised:
  - left front, left back
  - right front, right back


- Methodology used in previous research in chronic hamstring pain .font60[(Summers, 2020)]
]
---

## Data Analysis Plan

**Primary Aim - Implicit Motor Imagery**

To determine whether previous ACLR (and the side affected) influences left-right judgement:

- 3 (group; L ACLR, R ACLR, control) x 2 (side of image; left, right) &lt;br&gt; ANOVA controlling for age, with interaction term

- Seperate models for accuracy and reaction time, and also for knee and hand images 

---

## Data Analysis Plan

**Primary Aim - Auditory Detection Testing**

Previous research with this outcome has resulted in significantly skewed data with inability to run statistical comparisons .font60[(Summers, 2020)]

- Comparisons between sides and groups will be trialled with a Mann-Whitney U Test (if appropriate)

- Visual inference methods, in which an array of plots are used to make a graphical inference about the data .font60[(Wickham, 2010)]
  - valid method of analysis .font60[(Majumder, 2013)]
  - can be useful for where traditional statistical tests are unable to be used

## Study 5: 

### Optimising strength training after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by targeting central nervous system plasticity: A randomised controlled trial


---

## Background

- Muscle strength deficits persist, even after rehabilitation has finished

- Central nervous system changes are implicated as a factor in persistent muscle weakness .font60[(Pietrosimone, 2013)].

  - Our current rehabilitation approaches may not address these impairments .font60[(Criss, 2021)]

## Rationale

.content-box[Strategies to increase neurocoginitive demand and encourage neuroplasticity may target CNS impairments
]

.pull-left[
- Externally paced training .font60[(Leung, 2013)]

- Cueing strategies focused on external targets .font60[(Wulf, 2010)]
- Limited investigation in lower limb pain populations
]

.pull-right[
Motor imagery training
  - mental simulation of a task .font60[(Leung, 2013)]
  
  - target cortical representations of space, and with benefits to muscle strength

class: inverse, middle

## Aims

&gt; To compare: &lt;br&gt; i) motor imagery training of strength exercise, &lt;br&gt; ii) externally paced focused strength training  and &lt;br&gt; iii) traditional self paced strength training &lt;br&gt; - for strength and physical function outcomes.
